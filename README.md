> Write literate code in markdown, use gulp-literature to compile it

## About
[Literature](//github.com/AndreasPizsa/literature) generalizes the idea of Literate CoffeeScript to just any language. It’s just Markdown with code blocks, except that the code blocks are intended to be executed. There are basically only three rules:

* Regular, unfenced code blocks are executable code
* Fenced code blocks are documentation. (That’s handy for usage examples)
* `.litjs` or `.js.md` will result in a `.js` file, `.litc` or `.c.md` will create a `.c` file, etc.


## Example
#### Input
 `test.js.md`

```markdown
# Usage
Literature extracts (unfenced) code blocks - such as the following - from Markdown files:

    literature = require('literature');
    console.log(literature('test.js.md'));

Sending this file through Literature will output only the above two code lines.
```

#### Output
`test.js`
```javascript
literature = require('literature');
console.log(literature('test.js.md'));
```

You can now either directly execute this code or `pipe` it to other tools.


## Install
```bash
 npm install gulp-literature --save-dev
 ```

## Usage

#### API and Command Line
See the [`literature` API and CLI tool](//github.com/AndreasPizsa/literature).

#### Usage with Gulp
`gulpfile.js`
```js
var literature= require('gulp-literature');
var gulp      = require('gulp');
var jshint    = require('gulp-jshint');

gulp.task('compile',function(){
  return gulp.src('test/fixtures/unfenced-code.js.md')
    .pipe(literature())
    .pipe(jshint())
});
```

## Pull requests

Pull requests are encouraged! This project builds its our own documentation, so please remember to build the documentation with [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) before you submit your pull request! Please don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

### Building the docs

To build the docs, first make sure [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) is installed globally (`npm i -g verb-cli`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs), and/or [.verbrc.md](./.verbrc.md)
* Run `verb` in the command line
* Pull request!

Thanks!
